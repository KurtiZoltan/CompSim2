abstract = {Abstract We derive stencils, i.e., difference schemes, for differential operators for which the discretization error becomes isotropic in the lowest order. We treat the Laplacian, Bilaplacian (= biharmonic operator), and the gradient of the Laplacian both in two and three dimensions. For three dimensions ùí™(h2) results are given while for two dimensions both ùí™(h2) and ùí™(h4) results are presented. The results are also available in electronic form as a Mathematica file. It is shown that the extra computational cost of an isotropic stencil usually is less than 20\%. ¬© 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Numer Methods Partial Differential Eq, 2006},
